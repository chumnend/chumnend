Hello there ðŸ‘‹,

My name is Nicholas and I am a software developer based in Canada. Currently I spend most of my time in software land as a fullstack web developer, working with Javascript in the frontend and Python in the backend. I also enjoy messing around with Go in side projects. Feel free to reach out to me to collaborate on anything.
